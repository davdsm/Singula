    "text": "Application of powder paint through an electrostatic field, followed by polymerization at high temperature. The result is a uniform coating, resistant to corrosion, impacts and weather, with a durability between 10 to 20 years. Available in various colors and textures, it ensures a precise and high-quality finish.",

    "text": "Galvanization is a broader process that can encompass different methods of zinc coating. The most common is hot-dip galvanizing, where steel or iron is immersed in a molten zinc bath at about 450Â°C. This creates a robust protective layer, with greater resistance to corrosion and durability.",

    "text": "Before lacquering, we apply a zinc layer to reinforce protection against corrosion. This combination creates a double barrier, ensuring longevity and resistance, even under adverse conditions. Electrolytic zinc plating results in a thinner and more uniform layer, being suitable for smaller parts and applications where aesthetics and precision are important.",
